# Code Quality & Architecture Report

## 1. Overview
- **Strengths:** Modular Next.js architecture, Prisma ORM, strict ESLint rules (`no-alert`, `no-console`), typed routes, custom toast system, accessibility focus.
- **Challenges:** Dependency on external services (OpenRouter, database), heavy client bundles, some features co-located in large components, limited automated testing.

## 2. Code Quality Analysis

### Maintainability & Complexity
- Several components exceed 400 lines (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx`, `ai-recipe-generator/page.tsx`, `granulation-analyzer/page.tsx`).
  - **Impact:** Harder to test/maintain.
  - **Recommendation:** Extract subcomponents (`RecentOrders`, `WorklogSummary`, `AIModelCard`, etc.). Target max ~250 lines per component.
  - **Priority:** Medium.

### Best Practices
- ESLint enforced, React hooks rules satisfied.
- Typed routes and `Route` casting reduce navigation errors.
- Logger writes structured JSON to stdout/stderr.

### Error Handling
- Frontend uses toasts for success/error and graceful fallbacks.
- Backend: Many routes wrap in `try/catch` but lacking fine-grained responses (e.g., differentiate validation vs. server errors).
  - **Action:** Return standardized error schema `{ code, message, details }` and map HTTP status codes appropriately.
  - **Priority:** Medium.

### Async/Promise Management
- Client `fetch` calls use `async/await` with proper error handling.
- Missing `AbortController` on long-lived fetches except some AI flows.
  - **Action:** Add abort + cleanup on unmount in hooks to prevent memory leaks.

### Memory Usage & Event Listeners
- Navigation adds scroll listener with cleanup; good practice.
- AI components store large strings in state; consider `useMemo` and streaming displays (already done via SSE).

## 3. Architecture Assessment

### Component Structure & Separation of Concerns
- UI atoms in `src/components/ui`, feature bundles under `src/components/orders`, `worklogs`, etc.
- Pages still contain business logic (filters, fetches). Consider moving to hooks/services (`useOrders`, `useWorklogs`) for reuse.

### Scalability
- Prisma with indexes supports scaling; yet API routes fetch large data sets on initial load (limit=100). Introduce cursor pagination/infinite scroll for large corpora.
- AI features rely on external APIs; add job queue or rate limiting if usage increases.

### Technical Debt Hotspots
1. Large page components (`/`, `/ai-recipe-generator`) – refactor into domain modules.
2. Lack of integration tests for API routes and forms.
3. Hard-coded fallback URLs (`https://capsuledb.easyhealth.internal`) – ensure environment variable overrides.

## 4. Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern JS (optional chaining, async/await) supported in evergreen browsers. Next.js handles polyfills automatically.
- Tailwind CSS requires modern CSS features (e.g., `backdrop-filter`). For older Safari, ensure fallback background color.
- Recommend testing in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge at minimum.

## 5. Action Plan & Priorities

| Area | Finding | Recommendation | Impact | Expected Metric | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bundle Size | Large initial JS | Code-split AI components with `next/dynamic` | ↓ TTI | -15% JS payload | High |
| Component Size | Monolithic pages | Extract domain components/hooks | Maintainability | Reduced LOC per file | Medium |
| API Errors | Generic error responses | Standardize API error format & status | UX transparency | Fewer support tickets | Medium |
| Async Cleanup | Missing abort controllers | Add `AbortController` to fetches | Prevent leaks | Zero memory warning in audits | Medium |
| Testing | Limited automation | Add Playwright end-to-end tests for flows | Reliability | 80% critical path coverage | High |
| CSS Backdrop fallback | `backdrop-filter` reliance | Provide solid-color fallback | Compatibility | No visual regression on unsupported browsers | Low |

## 6. Monitoring & Tooling
- Add Jest/Playwright smoke suite triggered by CI.
- Use Bundle Analyzer (`next-bundle-analyzer`) to inspect chunks after refactors.
- Track error logs via hosted logging (e.g., Logtail) using structured logger output.

## 7. Target Outcomes
- **Maintainability:** Reduce top-level page files to <250 lines, improve readability.
- **Reliability:** Unified error schema across APIs, documented in README.
- **Scalability:** Introduce pagination for orders/worklogs when dataset grows beyond 1k records.
- **Compatibility:** Confirm styling on Safari/iOS via BrowserStack.

## 8. Next Steps
1. Assign tasks by priority (bundle optimization, testing, error format).
2. Schedule bi-weekly architecture review to monitor technical debt items.
3. Document code splitting and API error patterns in contributing guide.
